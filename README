PAB3 version 3.0.0
==================

PAB3 contains a framework to build rapid applications. It uses
templates to produce output. The templates are translated into
perl scripts before running them. This should perform the maximum of speed.
PAB3 also can handle database connections and provides an easy to use
interface to it. It can log all of the key actions, including the
elapsed time in a file. Several formating functions may help
genrating nice output.
It supports the CGI interface and has been optimized for running under
ModPerl or PerlEx environments.

It has been tested on unix, darwin and win32 platforms.
