PAB3 - Perl Application Builder / Version 3
===========================================

PAB3 contains a framework for building rapid applications with Perl.
It includes a template handler for producing output. The templates
are translated into perl scripts before running them. This should
perform the maximum of speed. PAB3 can handle database connections
and provides an easy to use interface to it. It can log all of the
key actions, including the elapsed time in a file. Several formating
functions may help generating nice output.
It supports the CGI interface and has been optimized for running under
ModPerl or PerlEx environments.

It has been tested on unix, darwin and win(32,x64) platforms.
